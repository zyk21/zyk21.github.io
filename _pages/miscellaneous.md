Before going to Tsinghua, I spent 7 years in the first class of Early Development Program (EDP) at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China ([RDFZ](https://www.rdfz.cn/en/)). The majority of my middle school years were spent playing soccer, basketball, *Magic the Gathering*, *Hearthstone*, and Rubik's Cube. 

I retired from soccer in 2012 after I scored an own goal in the most important match. As the starting center, I won the runner-up in the RDFZ basketball league with the EDP basketball team in 2014 (scoring about 2 points in each game). At Tsinghua, I scored a brilliant lob shot from the midfield against EE75 in 2017 but our EE73 soccer team was too weak. On the basketball court, the EE73 team never made to the final match of INFINITY CUP (basketball league of EE department) because of never-ending injuries. I also joined the volleyball team of EE department in 2022 as a middle blocker.

I also enjoy learning languages and Chinese dialects but am not good at speaking them. Recently I am learning Cantonese and French. I can speak some Japanese, Korean, and very little Russian. I enjoy watching Richii Mahjong matches and Korean variety shows (favorite: Runningman).
