Before going to Tsinghua, I spent 7 years in the first class of the Early Development Program (EDP) at The High School Affiliated to Renmin University of China ([RDFZ](https://www.rdfz.cn/en/)). The majority of my middle school years were spent playing soccer, basketball, *Magic the Gathering*, *Hearthstone*, and Rubik's Cube. 

I retired from soccer in 2012 after I scored an own goal in the most important match. As the starting center, I won the runner-up in the RDFZ basketball league with the EDP basketball team in 2014 (scoring about 2 points in each game). At Tsinghua, I scored a brilliant lob shot from the midfield against EE75 in 2017 but our EE73 soccer team was too weak. On the basketball court, the EE73 team never made it to the final match of INFINITY CUP (basketball league of EE department) because of never-ending injuries. I also joined the volleyball team of the EE department in 2022 as a middle blocker.

I also enjoy learning languages and Chinese dialects but am not good at speaking them. Recently I have been learning Cantonese and French. I can speak some Japanese, Korean, and very little Russian. I enjoy watching Riichi Mahjong matches.

Speedcubing
------

I started my speedcubing career in the spring of 2014 when I competed in the World Cube Association (WCA) Beijing Spring 2014. Here is my [WCA Profile](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2014ZHAN11). Winning 13 golds, 15 silvers, and 24 bronze medals in 40 WCA competitions in China and the U.S., I enjoy the amazing journey as a speedcuber.

In the second year of my speedcubing career, I broke the Chinese National Record of **Fewest Moves** events with a 23 moves single and tied the average record of 28.33 moves at Beijing Long Events Open 2015 held at my high school RDFZ. The reconstruction of my solutions can be found in this [post](http://bbs.mf8-china.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=105238&extra=page%3D2) at mf8-china.

I have competed in all 18 WCA events. Besides Fewest Moves, I have once ranked China TOP10 in **Rubik's Clock**, **Skewb**, and **Megaminx**. I once ranked 2nd in China on the “Sum of Ranks” Rankings in July 2017. After entering Tsinghua, I seldom practiced speedcubing and switched my focus to re-organizing Tsinghua’s Student Speedcubing Association. Under [MA Zeyu](https://mazeyu.github.io/)’s wise leadership, we successfully started up the association in 2019. I took over the association president in 2020 and I am now the vice president. Videos of the association’s events can be found on our [bilibili account](https://space.bilibili.com/1707749452/) account. I hope to promote speedcubing to more Tsinghua students and organize great competitions on campus.
